# =============================================================================
# Changing Directories
# =============================================================================

# If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, and the
# command is the name of a directory, perform the cd command to that directory.
setopt auto_cd

# Make cd push the old directory onto the directory stack.
setopt auto_pushd

# Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack.
setopt pushd_ignore_dups

# Allow for corrections when mistyping directory names with 'cd'.
# Zsh will suggest the closest match.
setopt correct_all

# Makes 'cd' change to the previous directory when no argument is given.
# Can be useful if you often switch between two directories.
setopt cdable_vars

# The prompt will display information about the status of a background job 
# if it starts or stops. Useful if you background tasks often.
setopt notify

# =============================================================================
# Completion
# =============================================================================

# If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a full
# completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of the word.
setopt always_to_end

# If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is started.
# Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from both ends.
setopt complete_in_word

# Don't beep on an ambiguous completion.

# Characters which are also part of a word.
# See 4.3.4 of http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide04.html.

# =============================================================================
# History
# =============================================================================

# Perform textual history expansion, csh-style, treating the character '!'
# specially.
unsetopt bang_hist

# If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line,
# setting this option will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate
# to be lost before losing a unique event from the list.
setopt hist_expire_dups_first

# When searching for history entries in the line editor, do not display
# duplicates of a line previously found, even if the duplicates are not
# contiguous.
setopt hist_find_no_dups

# Do not enter command lines into the history list if they are duplicates of the
# previous event.
setopt hist_ignore_dups

# Whenever the user enters a line with history expansion, don't execute the line
# directly; instead, perform history expansion and reload the line into the
# editing buffer.
setopt hist_verify

# This options works like APPEND_HISTORY except that new history lines are added
# to the $HISTFILE incrementally (as soon as they are entered), rather than
# waiting until the shell exits.
setopt inc_append_history

# Save each command’s beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the
# duration (in seconds) to the history file. The format of this prefixed data is:
# ‘: <beginning time>:<elapsed seconds>;<command>’.
